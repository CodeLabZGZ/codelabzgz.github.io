Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Example 1:

> **Input**: nums = [3,2,3]<br/>**Output**: 3

### Example 2:

> **Input**: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]<br/>**Output**: 2

### Constraints:

- $n == nums.length$
- $1 \le n \le 5 * 10^4$
- $-10^9 \le nums[i] \le 10^9$

**Follow-up**: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in $O(1)$ space?
